### Day 1: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CS50's problem set 1 - credit

**Thoughts**: It's quite complicated for a beginner but I got it right just within a couple hours.

### Day 2: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CS50 2nd weeks' Lab.

**Thoughts**: Not really complicated after all and I'm still working on the problem sets (I hope to complete tomorrow).
